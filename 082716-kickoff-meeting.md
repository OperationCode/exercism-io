# Team Charter

## Two Week Sprints

In a sprint, we agree on issues to work on, assign them, collaborate as needed, and then perform a retrospective at the end of the sprint.

We will have a Sprint planning every two weeks as much as possible (the time may shift around depending on people's schedules).

Before each sprint, I will select a list of Exercism.io Github issues that look like good things for us to work on, and seem achievable in a two week sprint.  If you see an issue on Exercism.io that you would like to work on, feel free to work on it, just let me know :)

During our Sprint planning meetings, we will assign ourselves to issues (either individually or in pairs or in groups) and talk through the potential implementation.  Talking through the implementation is one of the most valuable things I've found in Sprint planning meetings.  We will use a [Trello](https://trello.com/) board for keeping track of our work throughout the two weeks.

NOTE: If something comes up and you don't think you can complete your issue (especially those of you still on active duty!), no worries, just let me know and we can adjust things as needed.  This mentorship is meant to be valuable, but low stress.

# Action items

During this Meeting:
1. Set date of our sprint planning meeting
2. Create Trello board for Exercism Team Six
3. Invite everyone with a Github account to the operation

After this Meeting:
1. If you do not have a Github account, go ahead and create one (Everyone)
2. If you do not have a Trello account, go ahead and create one (Everyone)
3. Select some Exercism.io issues which would be appropriate for us to start with, consult with Katrina Owen as necessary, add to Trello board (Nell)
4. For now, if you see an issue on the Trello board (or in the Exercism.io Github issues), feel free to start work on it if you would like to!  We'll do more formal sprint planning starting with the next sprint planning meeting.
5. At anytime, feel free to reach out on #exercism-io channel in the Operation Code Slack for assistance, collaboration, or just to chat :)
