# Week One - Installing and Getting to know Exercism.io

This week (ending Saturday July 23) we will focus on getting Exercism.io set up and beginning to work through some of the exercises.

There is a fabulous guide to getting started with Exercism.io for new developers [here](http://exercism.io/how-it-works/newbie).  You can also check out the getting started guide for experience developers [here](http://exercism.io/how-it-works).

Set up an exercism.io account, set it up on your workstation, and start playing with it!  If you have any issues, feel free to mention them in the #exercism-io chat room in the Operation Code slack.
